## **Subsection: Q-Net**
### Q-Net: Optimizing the performance of off policy reinforcement learning algorithims using supervised meta learned networks as replacements. Combining both model and nonmodel reinforcement learning to acheive new heights of neural network training

## **Goals:**
- Outperform Q-Learning algorithims in training time and effectiveness
- If possible, generate a replacement to the Q algorithim that is generalized to all programs
- If possible, generate a model, so effective, that it replaces the existing RL algorithms that already outperform Q-Learning
